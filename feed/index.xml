<p>This cosmetics guru has <em>made up</em> her mind regarding how often one should clean their brushes.</p>
<p>A makeup professional, who posts on TikTok under the name @AskEllenBeauty, revealed the top five things she would never do as a beauty expert.</p>
<p>In a viral video with more than 2.1 million views, the Aussie said using makeup brushes too often without properly cleansing them can cause infection.</p>
<p>“I would never use my personal brush more than once before sanitizing it,” she said in her clip while putting on eyeshadow. “I once had a client who got a staph infection from using a dirty sponge — like her own dirty sponge obviously.”</p>
<p>While she suggested to “regularly sanitize and change” brushes, another tip was to never buy a limited-edition or holiday eyeshadow palette without testing it with swatches first.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/08/makeup-artist-brushes-06.jpg?w=577" alt="makeup" width="577" height="1024" />The Australian shared five things she “would never do” as a makeup artist.@askellenbeauty</p>
<p>“The items don’t have an economy of scale, so brands sometimes use a cheaper pigment in those items to save money,” Ellen explained. “That means even with a brand you know and like, the holiday palette is often chalky and not very good.”</p>
<p>She also suggested letting foundations dry before buying in order to ensure they’re a proper match.</p>
<p>Testing mascaras in beauty stores is also a big no-no. “Eye infections are just not worth it,” she said.</p>
<p>In a follow-up video, the makeup artist showed viewers how to properly wash the brushes using a small squeeze bottle of quick-drying spray by squirting a few spritzes on a cotton pad.</p>
<p>She then took her dirty brushes and scrubbed them vigorously until the gunky makeup wiped off, noting the whole cleaning process takes a mere 30 seconds to perfect thanks to Cinema Secrets’ makeup brush cleanser.</p>
<p>“No excuses,” she said.</p>
<p>A United Kingdom study published earlier this year revealed that makeup brushes can actually be dirtier than a toilet, with microscopic photos showing the brushes full of mold, bacteria, yeast and other nightmarish microbes.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/08/makeup-artist-brushes-02.jpg?w=577" alt="makeup " width="577" height="1024" />Ellen’s viral TikTok has garnered more than 2.1 million views since last month.@askellenbeauty</p>
<p>“It’s awful to see the amount of bacteria that could potentially sit on a makeup brush,” Dr. Suhail Alam, medical director at the Aventus Clinic, which conducted the research, told Jam Press in April.</p>
<p>“Even after a person uses a makeup brush for the first time, it will already be forming colonies of bacteria,” Alam said. “With daily use, the brushes will automatically start collecting dirt, pollutants, oil and dead skin cells, which is why makeup brushes act as a breeding ground for bacteria which can lead to breakouts and skin irritations.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/07/harry-styles-1.jpg?quality=75&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024" alt="You can take a college course in Harry Styles’ ‘masculinity’"></p>
<p>“Late Night Talking” will turn into late-night studying for some Texas college students.</p>
<p>Texas State University in San Marcos is offering a class about Harry Styles starting in the spring of 2023.</p>
<p>The course, titled “Harry Styles and the Cult of Celebrity: Identity, the Internet and European Pop Culture,” will be taught by Associate Professor of Digital History Dr. Louie Dean Valencia, who posted about it on social media over the weekend.</p>
<p>“It’s official, official. I’m teaching the world’s first ever university course on the work of Harry Styles,” he wrote.</p>
<p>The honors college course will focus on Styles’ music, in addition to “the cultural and political development of the modern celebrity as related to questions of gender and sexuality, race, class, nation and globalism, media, fashion, fan culture, internet culture, and consumerism,” according to the class flyer. </p>
<p>    <img loading="lazy" width="785" height="1024" src="https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/07/harry-styles-course-91.jpg?w=785" alt="harry styles course" />The course is titled “Harry Styles and the Cult of Celebrity: Identity, the Internet and European Pop Culture.”Louie Dean Valencia/Texas State    </p>
<p>Valencia told KXAN that he’s a “huge fan” of Styles and started listening to him during his One Direction days. He even went to see him in concert as part of Styles’ Love on Tour.</p>
<p>“As a historian, I want the class to get to really see how the world has changed in the last 12 years or so, but also how to put that into historical context, through the lens of Harry Styles,” he told KXAN.</p>
<p>The Post has reached out for comment on the curriculum from the “Watermelon Sugar” singer’s representatives.</p>
<p>The idea for the course came from research Valencia started during the coronavirus lockdown in the summer of 2020. </p>

<p>“When I couldn’t travel to do my regular research, I started researching Harry — focusing on his art, the ways masculinity has changed in the last decade, celebrity culture and the internet,” the professor told NBC Dallas-Fort Worth.</p>
<p>“Harry Styles and the Cult of Celebrity” will function like a history class. Assignments will include studying his music — his solo albums and One Direction albums — and films, with readings from Susan Sontag, Alain de Botton, Haruki Murakami and more. Students will also be required to create their own podcast.</p>
<p>Registration for the class begins this fall. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/07/Taja-Abitbol-1.jpg?quality=75&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024" alt="Yankees girlfriend Taja Abitbol denies setting fire for ‘RHONY’ bid"></p>
<p>Taja Abitbol wears many hats: mom, partner, entrepreneur, restaurateur. But she insists that she’s no fire starter.</p>
<p>This week, The Post reported that Abitbol, the longtime girlfriend of former Yankees and Mets pitcher David Cone, has been accused by a former neighbor in a lawsuit of starting a fire at the couple’s Manhattan apartment — allegedly in a bid to land a role on “The Real Housewives of New York City.”</p>
<p>Speaking exclusively to The Post, Abitbol, 50, denied the allegations. “This is just a vendetta against me, it’s jealousy,” she said. “[The neighbor] is accusing me of being an arsonist. That’s insane, and it’s defamatory.”</p>
<p>According to Abitbol, on the morning of Nov. 9, 2019, she lit a sage candle for her morning meditation in the dining room of her and Cone’s four-bedroom apartment in Lincoln Square.</p>
<p>As she said her prayers, Abitbol explained, the candle went up in flames, setting off the building’s sprinklers.</p>
<p>    <img loading="lazy" width="683" height="1024" src="https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/07/Taja-Abitbol-07.jpg?w=683" alt="Abitbol now lives in Miami with son Sammy and dog Billy, while Cone travels between Miami and his work in New York. " />Abitbol now lives in Miami with son Sammy and dog Billy, while Cone travels between Miami and his work in New York. Jeffery Salter for NY Post    </p>
<p>“I had never used this candle before,” said Abitbol: “And it had actual sage leaves inside the candle — I did not know that.</p>
<p>“I did not leave it unattended, but the sage somehow sparked and it went up in flames, but it didn’t cause a [big] fire. The sprinklers went off and the building [staff] couldn’t get the sprinklers to turn off. They had to break the hose to turn the water off. I was standing in water up to my knees.”</p>
<p>The NYPD and FDNY were called “immediately” to the incident, which was later ruled an accident, Abitbol said. A report by the fire department obtained by The Post confirmed this.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think they would know if it had been set deliberately?” she said. “I would have been arrested and sent to jail!”</p>
<p>She, Cone, their 10-year-old son, Sammy, and the family dog left the apartment and haven’t lived there since.</p>
<p>On her way out, Abitbol managed to grab important documents like passports and her son’s birth certificate, but has not seen the bulk of her belongings since 2019, she said.</p>

<p>“It was the worst time of my life … I had to pick my son up from school that day and tell him we were not going home. It was a horror show,” Abitbol said. “We’ve gone through hell, and now I’m being sued nearly four years later.”</p>
<p>According to the lawsuit, filed in Manhattan Supreme Court on July 1 by her downstairs neighbor Daniel Rice, the sprinklers significantly damaged his apartment.</p>
<p>“Daniel Rice is the real victim here. We take these types of claims very seriously, he takes them seriously, and he has been placed in a position where he had to act,” said his attorney Jonathan Temchin of Tarter Krinsky &amp; Drogin.</p>

<p>Rice also claimed in the lawsuit that Abitbol and Cone “deliberately, knowingly, intentionally and/or recklessly … caused the fire … in order for Abitbol to have a story to discuss on the ‘Tamron Hall Show’ and/or to advance Abitbol’s candidacy as a castmate for the Real Housewives of New York [City] television show, among other things.</p>
<p>“Abitbol’s desire for fame and notoriety is well-known,” Rice’s lawsuit — which Abitbol only found when a sports fan alerted her to it over Instagram — alleged.</p>
<p>Abitbol confirmed to The Post that she has spoken to Bravo execs in the past — and is close friends with a slew of “Housewives” stars, including New Jersey’s Teresa Giudice and Cynthia Bailey from the Atlanta show.  As to whether she wants to be on the show, she said: “Why not!”</p>

<p>Still, “One thing has nothing to do with the other,” Abitbol said, adding she has never met Rice. “This was a defective candle, it was a pure accident.”</p>
<p>Bailey was actually on her way to NYC to stay with Abitbol for a few days when she heard the apartment had flooded. “Taja was completely devastated,” said Bailey: “She couldn’t even talk on the phone. She was a mess … trying to figure out where she and her family were going to live.”</p>
<p>Abitbol, who grew up in Queens, added that the last time she went back to the rental property was in late 2019 to collect her family’s belongings and meet with insurance agents and building management. </p>

<p>Abitbol and Cone now split their time between their Florida home and NYC. Cone, 59, retired from baseball in 2003 and is now a color commentator on ESPN and the YES Network. Abitbol recently opened Taja Drip, a luxury wellness center in Miami offering vitamin IV infusions, based out of trendy South Beach hotel Faena, and has also started a skin care range and supplement line.</p>
<p>She believes that her former neighbor is targeting her family because of Cone’s status: “This guy is looking to sue me because David is a New York legend — he doesn’t deserve this, the poor guy.”</p>
<p>The two first met at her former restaurant Taja — a French Moroccan place in the Upper East Side that closed in 2007 — and then again at a holiday party in 2010. She said they are “longtime engagees” but have never wed. She has owned four restaurants in total, three in NYC and one in Las Vegas, but all are now shuttered.</p>
<p>    <img loading="lazy" width="683" height="1024" src="https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/07/taja-abitbol-04.jpg?w=683" alt="Taja Abitbol, (Photographed on location in Miami beach, FL) the girlfriend of former Yankees and Mets pitcher David Cone, who was sued for starting a fire at the couple’s Manhattan apartment in a bid to land a role on “The Real Housewives of New York City." />A Bravo source claims Taja Abitbol hasn’t reached out on possibly being on “The Real Housewives of New York City.”Jeffery Salter    <img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="701" src="https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/07/cone-yankees-01.jpg?w=1024" alt="Since retiring from the field, Cone is now a color commentator on ESPN and the YES network." />Since retiring from the field, Cone is now a color commentator on ESPN and the YES network.Getty Images    </p>
<p>Rice,  who is suing both Abitbol and Cone for at least $320,000 in damages, claimed in his lawsuit the couple “negligently and wantonly left candles burning in Unit 14B which started a fire and caused significant damage to Unit 12G.”</p>
<p>The damage from the blaze and water sprinklers forced him to carry out a “gut renovation” of the home, the lawsuit claims, during which time he was forced to find “alternative temporary living arrangements.”</p>
<p>The lawsuit notes that Rice, an Army vet, received a Purple Heart when he was injured by an improvised explosive device in 2005 after serving multiple tours in the Middle East. He is currently serving as the Special Advisor to Commander-in-Chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces General Valeriy Zaluzhnyy in the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the court papers said.</p>

<p>Abitbol’s attorney, celebrity favorite Stephanie Ovadia, confirmed to The Post this week that she had filed a lawsuit in the Supreme Court of New York in November 2021 against the Chinese manufacturer of the candle, The Sunny Factory LLC. The Post has seen the filing.</p>
<p>Abitbol originally bought the Magnificent 101 Sage Leaf Energy Cleansing Candle for $13.49 on Amazon.com. Ovadia said Abitbol brought the suit in an attempt to get back funds that her insurance didn’t cover. They have yet to hear back from the manufacturer.</p>
<p>    <img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="682" src="https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/07/real-housewives-of-new-york-retu.jpeg.jpg?w=1024" />Asked if she would ever join “The Real Housewives of New York City” (above), Abitbol said, “Why not!”Bravo    </p>
<p>A day after the incident, Abitbol was interviewed on the “Tamron Hall Show.” To promote her appearance, the show’s Twitter account posted on the day of the fire: “We’re talking to Taja Abitbol. She’s obsessed with astrology and recently didn’t think what her astrologists said would come true but it did.”</p>
<p>During her appearance on the show, Abitbol explained how her astrologers predicted she would move out of the apartment she had just moved into.</p>
<p>“Yesterday morning, I basically set the house on fire during Mercury retrograde and I had to move. I came here from my hotel room,” the lawsuit quoted Abitbol as telling Hall.</p>
<p>    <img loading="lazy" width="683" height="1024" src="https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/07/Taja-Abitbol-12.jpg?w=683" />“Housewives” star Jill Zarin called Abitbol “a brilliant business woman.”Jeffery Salter for NY Post    </p>
<p>But Abitbol said she was never even meant to take part in the episode. Her friend, an astrologer, called hours after the blaze and asked Abitbol to take her place as a guest,  she said.</p>
<p>Jill Zarin, a “RHONY” star and longtime friend of Abitbol and Cone, this week said that she stands behind her pal. “She’s a brilliant business woman with a legitimate, successful business,” she told The Post. </p>
<p>“It was water that damaged the guy’s apartment, not fire,” Zarin added. “It was nothing to do with the show.” </p>
<p>    <img loading="lazy" width="683" height="1024" src="https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/07/Taja-Abitbol-06.jpg?w=683" />Cynthia Bailey of “The Real Housewives of Atlanta” said Abitbol (above) would be “great” on one of the shows: “She’s perfect … it just hasn’t happened yet.”Jeffery Salter for NY Post    </p>
<p>Bailey agreed. “I’ve been on this show for 11 years, I’ve seen it all — and I never once heard of anyone doing anything so crazy to try to be on the show!</p>
<p>“Taja would be great on a ‘Housewives’ franchise, for sure. She’s accomplished, successful, self-made, she is an entrepreneur. She’s funny and beautiful, she’s perfect … it just hasn’t happened yet.</p>
<p>A Bravo source told The Post that they’re not aware of any interest from the network in Abitbol, and said that such antics would certainly not help. </p>
<p>    <img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="682" src="https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/07/david-cone-01.jpg?w=1024" alt="Former Yankee pitcher David Cone is now a commentator for the New York Yankees on the YES Network." />Former New York Yankees pitcher David Cone and Taja Abitbol have been together for 10 years.<br />Corey Sipkin    <img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/07/taja-abitbol-david-cone-02.jpg?w=1024" alt="David Cone and Taja Abitbol speak while commemorating the pitcher’s 20th anniversary of his perfect game with the New York Yankees on on June 19, 2019." />David Cone and Taja Abitbol speak while commemorating the pitcher’s 20th anniversary of his perfect game with the New York Yankees on on June 19, 2019.Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images for The David Cone Foundation Gala    </p>
<p>“That is not the way to land a spot but rather a way to lose one!” they said.</p>
<p>But Zarin certainly understands why Abitbol might want to be cast. “She saw what the show did for my business, and why wouldn’t she want that for her business?” Zarin told The Post. “There’s no shame in that game.”</p>
<p>Abitbol — whose first name means “Crown” in Sanskrit — added: “I’m not a wannabe, I’m the hardest working person there is.”</p>

<p>SPIELBERG, Austria &#8212; Zhou Guanyu was worried he would be trapped upside down in a burning car after his huge crash at the British Grand Prix last week.</p>
<p>Zhou was flipped upside down and over a tyre barrier, where his Alfa Romeo then got stuck in a small gap next to a wall.</p>

<p>The Chinese driver, who said F1&#8217;s Halo device saved his life, was initially worried about the fact he was unable to get out of the car &#8212; eventually he had to wriggle out of the cockpit a little way before marshals at Silverstone could get him out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once I was stopped I didn&#8217;t know where I was because I was upside down, and the next thing I felt was some leaking,&#8221; Zhou said in his first media session since the accident. &#8220;I was not sure if it was from my body or from the car, so I just tried to switch the engine off because the engine was still on at that point.</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew if a fire started it would be difficult to get out, so I switched my engine off, and then everything was fine.&#8221;</p>
<p>The crash raised several new safety concerns and is being investigated</p>
<p>The impact of the top of Zhou&#8217;s car hitting the tarmac was greater than is specified in FIA safety tests. The car&#8217;s roll-hoop was destroyed by the impact, meaning the Alfa Romeo was sliding along the floor on the Halo.</p>
<p>This weekend&#8217;s Austrian Grand Prix gives Zhou an immediate chance to return to racing, something he said is important for getting his head in the right place and shaking off any lingering anxiety.</p>
<p>&#8220;Already on Sunday I watched the race back. I didn&#8217;t feel sick watching it or have that feeling.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel like I was able to digest a bit myself, so I was happy mentally just having one day off and then went back into checking my physical condition. For me it wasn&#8217;t a concern.</p>
<p>&#8220;Obviously there are times you do something and you need a bit of mental help, but this time I didn&#8217;t feel it was needed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zhou added: &#8220;Sunday night I was texting all my engineers asking, is my seat OK? For drivers the seat is very important. It&#8217;s been very comfortable so far, but it can be different even if they try to do the same.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton said Zhou&#8217;s accident should act as another wake-up call over the ongoing dangers of the sport.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are still areas for improvement [in safety],&#8221; he said. &#8220;Jeez, the car getting stuck behind the barrier and the driver getting stuck in the car, we&#8217;ve got to make sure that doesn&#8217;t happen again.</p>
<p>&#8220;But sometimes these experiences are what open up our eyes to how much more we can improve and we will continue to do that. It&#8217;s amazing to see today how safe these cars are that you can get out and walk away, and I&#8217;m glad the drivers are safe. But It&#8217;s also a reminder to the people watching that this is a dangerous sport. We take real risks out there at crazy speeds.</p>
<p>&#8220;Often people tune in and even people there that have known the sport for ages, sometimes take it for granted. We&#8217;re not just cruising around on a safety bumper kart. We&#8217;re exposed in a couple of areas and we&#8217;ve not got to take that for granted.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/07/dudolf-coco-comp.jpg?quality=75&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024" alt="You’re in the top 1% if you spot all the nuts in this optical illusion"></p>
<p>Trying to find the hidden fruits in a sea of bears in this optical illusion could drive you coconuts. </p>
<p>In this mind-boggling illustration by Hungarian author-artist Gergely Dudás — aka The Dudolf — there are three brown “coconuts” among dozens of bear heads. </p>
<p>Some of the featured Teddies are sporting various styles of ties, and one even chose a top hat. Another is sporting a Harry Potter-style neck scarf.</p>
<p>Most of the bears are a shade of brown, while there are a handful of white bears sprinkled throughout the picture to tease the eye. </p>
<p>OK, here’s a clue: Like the bears, the coconuts appear to have two dots as eyes and one for a mouth — but they do not have ears as the animals do.</p>
<p>The end result is so tricky that people who can spot the coconuts within 30 seconds are in the top one percent. </p>
<p>Done looking? Scroll down to see where the coconuts are hiding. </p>
<p>[Warning: Spoilers Below]</p>
<p>    <img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="682" src="https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/07/dudolf-coco-comp.jpg?w=1024" alt="Bear, coconut optical illusion" />You are in the top one percent if you can spot the coconuts in this sea of bears in 30 seconds or less.DUDOLF   	 	   </p>
<p>As we mentioned before, there are three coconuts in the illusion. If you divide the picture down the center, two of them are on the right side and the other is on the left. </p>
<p>The ones to the right is stuck in the top and bottom regions of the photo while the coconut on the left is in the middle region. </p>
<p>Yes, they look more like yawning newborn babies than coconuts — but that’s beside the brain-teasing point. </p>
<p>Anyways, if that was too easy, try one of these: Puzzle lovers are blowing a gasket trying to decipher this numerical eye exam, which can reportedly only be solved by 0.1% of people who attempt these things. The vexing visual jigsaw was first shared on TikTok in April but is currently blowing up as viewers strain their orbital muscles trying to crack it.</p>
<p>How about this one: If you can spot the mouse in this optical illusion in less than a minute, you may be a record holder.</p>
<p>    <img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="1024" src="https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/07/dudolf-coco-sol-1.jpg?w=1024" alt="Bear, coconut optical illusion" />Did you find the coconuts hidden in the sea of bears?DUDOLF        </p>
<p>Sure, optical illusions such as this are often just a fun diversion — but they also hold scientific value for medical professionals. These brain teasers often help researchers shed light on the inner machinations of the human mind and how it reacts to its surroundings.</p>
<p>Dr Gustav Kuhn, a psychologist and human perception expert at Goldsmiths University in London, once told The Sun that illusions are important to our understanding of the brain: “We typically take perception for granted, and rarely think about the hard work that underpins everyday tasks, such as seeing a cup of coffee in front of you.”</p>

<p>Zachary Levi is getting candid about his lifelong battles with anxiety, mental health and depression.</p>
<p>The 41-year-old actor details his struggles in his new book “Radical Love: Learning To Accept Yourself and Others,” as well as trying to find a place where he achieved self-love.</p>
<p>Levi opened up about his battles with suicidal thoughts and his mental breakdown at age 37 with journalist Elizabeth Vargas on her “Heart of the Matter” podcast ahead of his book’s release, according to the Hollywood Reporter.</p>
<p>The “Shazam!” star noted, “I didn’t realize that I was struggling with these things until I was 37, about five years ago . . . and I had a complete mental breakdown.”</p>
<p>    <img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="682" src="https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/06/Zachary-Levi-66.jpg?w=1024" />The “Shazam!” star revealed that the incident occurred once he moved to Austin, Texas, about five years ago. FilmMagic    </p>
<p>He said the breakdown happened once he moved to Austin, Texas, and he realized what was happening when he was just driving around town and could not decide on a restaurant to eat at.</p>
<p>“I’m sitting in my truck, and vividly, I remember I was holding onto the wheel and I was just shaking back and forth, that like almost trying to shake myself out of what it was going on, and I’m just weeping. I’m just crying,” he recounted. “I’m like, ‘God, help me.’ “</p>
<p>    <img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="682" src="https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/06/Zachary-Levi-67.jpg?w=1024" alt="CinemaCon 2022" />“I had been in dark places in my life before, but I guess in those moments I had people around me,” Levi added. WireImage    </p>
<p>He explained he even had “very active thoughts of ending my life.” Despite them not being the first time, this instance was different as he “didn’t have anybody” after moving to Texas.</p>
<p>“I didn’t have a support structure. So, in this particular moment, I’m out here in this wonderful city, but basically by myself, and the darkness surrounds me again,” he said.</p>
<p>He went on, “The lies are whispering into my ear and the failure that I felt that I was enough to be like, ‘Zach, it doesn’t feel like you’re going to make it out of this.’ “</p>
<p>A friend of his then suggested he go through “intensive life-changing, life-saving therapy” at a psychiatric hospital for about a month.</p>
<p>    <img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="682" src="https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/06/Zachary-Levi-68.jpg?w=1024" alt="CinemaCon 2022" />Levi’s book “Radical Love: Learning To Accept Yourself and Others” will be released on June 28.Getty Images    </p>
<p>The “Chuck” alum also explained that he spent his childhood growing up with a stepfather who had high expectations of him and a mother “who was a borderline personality.”</p>
<p>He later turned to “sex or drugs or booze” to sedate himself “from the pain that I was running away from most of my life.” </p>
<p>Levi said: “The irony is that booze can give you this temporary relief, but then the next day amplifies that anxiety tenfold. So, then you’re running back to get more and it just becomes this vicious cycle.”</p>
<p>The “Tangled” star’s next project will be the “Spy Kids” franchise reboot and he will be appearing alongside “Jane the Virgin” alum Gina Rodriguez.</p>
<p>The plot line of the as-yet-untitled revival reads: “When the children of the world’s greatest secret agents unwittingly help a powerful game developer unleash a computer virus that gives him control of all technology, they must become spies themselves to save their parents and the world.”</p>
<p><em>If you or someone you know is affected by any of the issues raised in this story, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-TALK (8255) or text the Crisis Text Line at 741741.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2022%2F0626%2Fr1029428_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg" alt="Yanks end historic hitless drought in walk-off win"></p>
<p>NEW YORK &#8212; Aaron Judge walked over to the stands and gave his bat to Spike Lee, a New York Yankees fan famous for scripting Hollywood dramas.</p>
<p>This weekend&#8217;s Yankees-Houston Astros series had all the ups, downs and twist endings audiences could handle. And when baseball&#8217;s award season arrives, bet on critics taking a hard look at Judge&#8217;s leading role.</p>
<p>&#8220;I told him I have to quit taking him for granted,&#8221; Yankees manager Aaron Boone said.</p>
<p>Judge drove a three-run homer in the 10th inning for his second walk-off hit against the Astros in four days, and New York recovered after nearly being no-hit for the second consecutive game to beat Houston 6-3 on Sunday.</p>
<p>&#8220;These guys, they never waver,&#8221; Judge said. &#8220;They stick to their plan, stick to their approach and continue to grind it out. And then Big G hit one about 120 to center, so it was all good.&#8221;</p>
<p>Giancarlo Stanton ended a historic hitless drought for New York with a one-out, 111 mph homer in the seventh inning, and DJ LeMahieu followed with a tying two-run drive in the eighth as New York split a four-game series between the American League&#8217;s top teams.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ended up Judge 2, Us 2,&#8221; Houston manager Dusty Baker said.</p>
<p>After Michael King stranded the bases loaded in the 10th, Isiah Kiner-Falefa dropped a two-strike bunt that moved automatic runner Aaron Hicks to third. Right-hander Seth Martinez intentionally walked pinch hitter Matt Carpenter and struck out LeMahieu, setting up a two-out showdown with Judge.</p>
<p>2 Related</p>
<p>Just like on Thursday, when he broke a 6-all tie with a single in the ninth, Judge lifted the major league-leading Yankees. His 112 mph rocket to left-center on a slider landed in the visiting bullpen for his big league-high 28th home run.</p>
<p>&#8220;What I marveled at was just how easy he swung,&#8221; Boone said. &#8220;It&#8217;s like he&#8217;s just trying to touch the ball.&#8221;</p>
<p>With their 10th walk-off win this year &#8212; and third off the bat of Judge &#8212; the Yankees improved to 53-20 and matched the third-best 73-game start in the majors since 1930, trailing only the 2001 Seattle Mariners and the 1998 Yankees.</p>
<p>New York is 24-1 when Judge and Stanton homer in the same game, including 8-0 this season.</p>
<p>&#8220;We got the best team on the planet,&#8221; Judge said.</p>
<p>But the Yankees hardly hit like a juggernaut most of the weekend. Jose Urquidy was eight outs from Houston&#8217;s second straight no-hitter before Stanton connected, cutting the Astros&#8217; lead to 3-1. The Yankees had been 0-for-52 since the eighth inning of a 3-1 loss Friday night &#8212; a stretch including a combined no-hitter by Cristian Javier, Hector Neris and Ryan Pressly on Saturday.</p>
<p>&#8220;You could tell they were coming at us with everything they had,&#8221; LeMahieu said.</p>
<p>New York&#8217;s 16-inning hitless drought was the longest by any team since at least 1961, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. No team has ever been no-hit in consecutive games, although the 1917 Chicago White Sox were no-hit on consecutive days by the St. Louis Browns, with the second gem coming in the second game of a doubleheader.</p>
<p>King (5-1) had to wriggle out of trouble in the 10th after New York&#8217;s defense slipped up twice. Shortstop Kiner-Falefa booted Jose Altuve&#8217;s grounder, and catcher Jose Trevino&#8217;s attempt to pick off Jason Castro at second base backfired when Castro took third.</p>
<p>King walked Alex Bregman with one out to load the bases then retired Kyle Tucker and Yuli Gurriel. King reached 100 mph for the first time in his career during the at-bat against Bregman.</p>
<p>The Astros have become every bit as hated in the Bronx as the rival Boston Red Sox after eliminating New York from the postseason three times since 2015 &#8212; including during their scandal-tainted title run in 2017. A crowd of 44,028 slumped in their seats most of the afternoon; the biggest cheers early on came for a cloud that briefly subdued the blazing afternoon sun.</p>
<p>Altuve hushed his harassers by hammering Nestor Cortes&#8217; first pitch, matching ex-teammate George Springer for the major league lead with seven leadoff homers. Mauricio Dubon added a two-run single in the fourth.</p>
<p>Altuve also walked twice and stole two bases.</p>
<p>Houston star Michael Brantley was replaced in the eighth inning after experiencing right shoulder discomfort. The five-time All-Star was 0-for-3, dropping his batting average to .288.</p>
<p>The Astros also were without slugger Yordan Alvarez, held out of the lineup with a lingering hand issue. He pinch hit against Clay Holmes in the ninth inning and was intentionally walked.</p>
<p>The Yankees&#8217; Gleyber Torres was stranded at third base in the ninth when he turned his right ankle and was easily picked off while writhing in the dirt. Boone said he has a mild sprain.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t expect it to be serious,&#8221; Boone said.</p>
<p>With a day off on Monday, it&#8217;s possible Torres is right back in the lineup on Tuesday, when the Yankees open a home series against the Oakland Athletics.</p>
<p>Ryne Stanek extended his AL-best scoreless streak to 19⅓ innings. Martinez (0-1) had the second longest run at 17⅔ innings prior to Judge&#8217;s blast, helping Houston enter with a major league-best 2.63 ERA.</p>
<p>Baker said he didn&#8217;t consider walking Judge, who had Anthony Rizzo hitting behind him. The manager also said Pressly and Neris weren&#8217;t available after pitching on Saturday.</p>
<p>Urquidy allowed the one hit over seven innings. He walked three and struck out three on 98 pitches.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the best game he&#8217;s thrown,&#8221; Baker said.</p>
<p>Plate umpire Mike Muchlinski took a foul tip off his mask in the first inning and staggered back before being grabbed by Yankees catcher Trevino. Muchlinski consulted with a trainer and the rest of the umpiring crew before remaining behind the plate. The game was completed with three umpires.</p>

<p>Wynonna Judd opened up about “the pain” of losing her mother and longtime singing partner Naomi Judd to suicide. </p>
<p>“There is so much happening in the world right now. So before I sat down to write this, I thought, ‘No…I just don’t know what to say.’ Then, I heard the words from my life coach asking me, ‘What do you know?’ And I began to cry,” Wynonna, 58, wrote in an emotional Instagram post. </p>
<p>The country music icon, 76, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound on April 30 after struggling with her mental health for several years.</p>
<p>    <img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="682" src="https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/05/judd-09.jpg?w=1024" alt="Wynonna Judd and Naomi Judd of The Judds attend the 2022 CMT Music Awards at Nashville Municipal Auditorium on April 11, 2022" />Wynonna Judd (left) said “the pain” of losing her mother Naomi Judd “to suicide is so great” in an emotional Instagram post. Getty Images for CMT    </p>
<p>“WHAT DO I KNOW?? I DO know, that the pain of losing Mom on 4/30 to suicide is so great, that I often feel like I’m not ever going to be able to fully accept and surrender to the truth that she left the way she did. This cannot be how The Judds story ends,” she wrote.</p>
<p>    <img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="682" src="https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/05/judd-15.jpg?w=1024" alt="Wynonna Judd speaks during a tribute to her mother, country music star Naomi Judd, Sunday, May 15," />Wynonna wrote, “I often feel like I’m not ever going to be able to fully accept and surrender to the truth that she left the way she did.”AP    </p>
<p>“I DO know, that in order to be a healthier grandparent to my firstborn grandchild Kaliyah, {born 4/13, 2 weeks &amp; 2 days before Mom left}, to break the cycle of addiction &amp; family dysfunction, that I must continue to show up for myself {first} and do the personal healing work,” Wynonna said. </p>
<p>She acknowledged that there is “a simple steps program” but noted that “those steps are not easy to take at times.” Yet, the grieving daughter has “made a commitment to keep doing the “next right thing,” and “schedule weekly appointments” to continue to work through the pain. </p>
<p>The singer continued, “I DO know, that I feel so helpless — right now especially.”</p>
<p>“I DO know, that as corny as it sounds, ‘Love Can Build A Bridge.’ I find myself humming the song that Mom wrote for the fans, to myself here on the farm at night,” she added. “I really DO know, that I’m not able to do this grieving thing all by myself, and that it’s okay to reach out for help. I will continue to fight for my faith, for my SELF, for my family, and I WILL continue to show up &amp; sing.”</p>

<p>Wynonna ended the post by thanking her fans and friends for their love and support. </p>
<p>She previously announced that she will continue the 11-date national tour she had scheduled with her mom before her untimely death.</p>
<p>“After a lot of thought, I’m going to have to honor her and do this tour. I’m just going to have to,” she said.</p>
<p>Naomi had been candid about her mental health struggles in the past. In 2016, she revealed her battles with “extreme” and “severe depression” that left her housebound on “Good Morning America.” </p>

<p>That same year she wrote a book, “River of Time: My Descent Into Depression and How I Emerged With Hope,” to go public with her diagnosis and to let people know that mental illness is “not a character flaw, it’s a stinking disease.”</p>
<p>Naomi’s daughter Ashley Judd, 54, revealed that she was the one to find her mother’s body. “I have both grief and trauma from discovering her,” she previously shared on “Good Morning America.”</p>
<p>Naomi’s husband, Larry Strickland, 76, has since admitted that he was terrified and knew she was in a “fragile” state. </p>

<p>Yumi Nu is “winning” with her Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue cover.</p>
<p>The 25-year-old model hit back at Jordan Peterson’s negative comments about her appearance in a TikTok clip that has amassed over 560,000 views.</p>
<p>Lip-syncing to Nicki Minaj’s “Itty Bitty Piggy,” she mouths the lyrics to the song in front of a screenshot of Peterson’s tweet.</p>
<p>“I don’t even know why you girls bother at this point,” she mouthed. “Give up. It’s me. I win. You lose.”</p>
<p>Her video comes after Peterson — a Canadian author of “12 Rules for Life” known to his 5 million YouTube subscribers as a conservative pundit who shares his views on cultural and political issues — shamed her Sports Illustrated cover.</p>
<p>He quote tweeted The Post’s original story, writing, “Sorry. Not beautiful. And no amount of authoritarian tolerance is going to change that.”</p>

<p>TikTokers quickly showered the cover star in applause.</p>
<p>“You did win cuz Jordan b. Peterson is leaving Twitter (hopefully) after he got blasted on the thread,” someone wrote, noting that Peterson said he’s quitting the platform.</p>
<p>“Single handedly got Jordan Peterson off Twitter. &amp; looked AMAZING while doing it. Queeeen,” said another.</p>

<p>Despite catching some heat from Twitter users, Peterson hit back at their critiques of his statement, saying, “It’s a conscious progressive attempt to manipulate &amp; retool the notion of beauty, reliant on the idiot philosophy that such preferences are learned &amp; properly changed by those who know better.”</p>
<p>While some people threw shade at Petersons’ own appearance, others argued that Nu does fit beauty standards.</p>
<p>“Dude, she’s hot,” replied another Twitter user.</p>

<p>In an earlier interview with The Post, Nu said it’s “amazing” to be featured on magazine covers.</p>
<p>“I’m on cloud nine,” she said. “This is nothing I could prepare for. It’s unexpected. I feel like we’re in a place right now where people are making space for more diversity on magazine covers. It’s a big time for Asian-American people in media. I know I play a big role in representation in body diversity and race diversity, and I love to be a role model and representative of the plus-size Asian community.”</p>

<p>While the SI cover is her latest feat, Nu, who grew up in New Jersey, Maryland and California, has also graced Vogue’s September issue as a cover model. She also appeared on the front of Vogue Japan, snagging the groundbreaking title of first Asian curve cover-model for the mag. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/05/YumiNuSISwimsuit2022.jpg?quality=75&amp;strip=all&amp;w=920" alt="Yumi Nu ‘shaking’ over SI Swimsuit cover reveal"></p>
<p>Last week, model Yumi Nu visited her agent for what she thought was a routine interview and career check in. </p>
<p>But while she was answering questions earnestly, “My agents were in on this little plan,” the 25-year-old told The Post. Midway through the “interview,” Sports Illustrated Swimsuit honcho MJ Day and other staffers from the bikini bible popped out with a camera crew as the cover of this year’s magazine, featuring Nu, filled a nearby monitor.</p>
<p>“I was processing the surprise of it not being a real interview and that this was actually the SI cover reveal. I could not speak. I had full body chills. I was shaking, I was crying. They really got me good,” said Nu.</p>
<p>Her first call was to her boyfriend Dimitri Dinas.</p>
<p>“He was freaking out. He was like, ‘If I were a teenage boy, I’d have a poster of you in my room. Now I’m dating an SI cover star.’ “</p>
<p>He has many reasons to be proud of his girlfriend. It’s been a stretch of career highlights for the plus-sized model and singer who is of Dutch and Japanese extraction. (Her mother is the daughter of Benihana founder Rocky Aoki, and she is the niece of DJ Steve Aoki). She was part of an ensemble of supermodels to grace the cover of the iconic September Vogue issue, and in April, she was the first Asian curve model to land the cover of Vogue Japan. </p>
<p>“It’s amazing. I’m on cloud nine. This is nothing I could prepare for. It’s unexpected. I feel like we’re in a place right now where people are making space for more diversity on magazine covers. It’s a big time for Asian-American people in media. I know I play a big role in representation in body diversity and race diversity, and I love to be a role model and representative of the plus-size Asian community.” </p>
<p>Born in New Jersey, Nu moved to Maryland as a tot, and at 14, her family went out to California, where she attended high school. As a young child, she started her career in front of the camera, but the first stint was fleeting.</p>
<p>    <img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="682" src="https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/05/1397569989.jpg?w=1024" alt="Yumi Nu and Editor In Chief at Sports Illustrated Swimsuit MJ Day attend the Yumi Nu 2022 Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Cover Reveal on May 11, 2022 in New York City." />Yumi Nu at the cover real on May 11.Getty Images for SI Swimsuit    <img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="682" src="https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/05/454460278.jpg?w=1024" alt="Model Devon Aoki and DJ Steve Aoki are Nu's aunt and uncle " />Model Devon Aoki and DJ Steve Aoki are Nu’s aunt and uncle.

<p>“My mom had experience in commercial modeling, so when we lived in New Jersey, she would take me to do some kids catalogs. When you are a toddler and screaming and crying, you have no sense of self control. She knew I wasn’t enjoying it,” said Nu.</p>
<p>The beauty returned to modeling when she was 12, the same age she started singing lessons. By 15, she was writing her own songs and realistically saw her future in the music world.</p>
<p>“I wasn’t sure where the [modeling] industry was headed. I think I was a size 10 then, and the only people working were either a size 2 or a size 14. I really had my sights set on music, but then the industry left more room for me to be a part of it. Once the trends of inclusion came upon us, it was easier for me to make a living and a career out of it. It was like, ‘Oh, there are so many possibilities, and there are no bounds on what anyone can do now,’ ” she said.</p>
<p>She is quick to credit Ashley Graham and Sports Illustrated for fostering that seismic shift. In 2016, Graham landed the cover, shattering norms and opening the door for a variety of body shapes to take center stage.</p>
<p>“Her SI cover changed so many people’s lives, and I think it changed the industry because you have this legendary publication putting its first curve model on the cover,” she said, adding that Hunter McGrady has also served as an inspiration.</p>

<p>But Nu doesn’t have to look beyond her family tree for insight and support, particularly her mother’s sister, Devon Aoki. </p>
<p>“She has a cult following and will be a classic model for the rest of time. She has really helped me this year now that I am working with a lot of bigger names, like Steven Meisel. She has helped me stay grounded and remember why I am doing what I am doing.”</p>
<p>On Friday she is also releasing her EP, “Hajime,” which is Japanese for “the beginning.” </p>
<p>But as Nu is multitasking in both the music and modeling world, she is looking forward to a break, which includes lounging and episodes of Netflix’s “Grace and Frankie.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think hustle culture is something I want to promote,” she said. “I want to enjoy life.”</p>
